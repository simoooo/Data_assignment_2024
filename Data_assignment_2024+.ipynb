    "# * High-CLV Customers\n",
    "# * Low-CLV Customers \n",

    "# Optimisation of Marketing Spend Based on CLV\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# * By comparing the CLV of customers acquired through different channels (e.g., social media ads, email marketing, referral programs), we can determine which channels bring the most valuable customers.\n",
    "# * If customers acquired via social media ads have an average CLV of $5000 but those from referral programs have an average CLV of $15000, we would  consider investing more in referral programs.\n",
    "# Actionable Insights:\n",
    "# * Channel prioritisation: Shift marketing budgets toward channels that attract high-CLV customers, and reduce spending on channels that drive low-CLV customers.\n",
    "# * Campaign adjustments: Adjust messaging or offers on channels with lower CLV to target higher-value customers.\n",
